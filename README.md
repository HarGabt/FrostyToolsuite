# FORK NOTE

This fork of Frosty Tool Suite 1.0.7 is based on [selphea's fork of 1.0.7](https://github.com/selphea/FrostyToolsuite) and is aimed at bringing some of the features from 1.0.6.3 (and 1.0.6.4 as well) if possible, along with keeping NFS Unbound's SDK file up-to-date.
<br>The backport commits in this fork bear the "throw and see what sticks and doesn't fail during build" philosophy and you have all the rights to take all of the actions here with a grain of sea salt.

And please, don't ask for help for this fork of 1.0.7 or 1.0.7 as whole at all. [Original developers of Frosty Tool Suite 1.0.7 have discontinued it and no longer provide help for it](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/951527850727600158/1221355214183989278/image.png?ex=661246ae&is=65ffd1ae&hm=5bea81af67c730e7477ae897158a4ec6bf59d994dea1327803dfe155dcc85a99&), which means you are on your own if something goes wrong.
