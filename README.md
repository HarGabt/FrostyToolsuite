# FORK NOTE

This fork of Frosty Tool Suite 1.0.7 is based on [selphea's fork of 1.0.7](https://github.com/selphea/FrostyToolsuite) and is aimed at bringing some of the features from 1.0.6.3 (and 1.0.6.4 as well) if possible, along with keeping NFS Unbound's SDK file up-to-date.
<br>The backport commits in this fork bear the "throw and see what sticks and doesn't fail during build" philosophy and you have all the rights to take all of the actions here with a grain of sea salt.

And please, don't ask for help for this fork of 1.0.7 or 1.0.7 as whole at all. [Original developers of Frosty Tool Suite 1.0.7 have discontinued it and no longer provide help for it](https://images2.imgbox.com/a6/a1/CqTQvcGL_o.png), which means you are on your own if something goes wrong.

# FrostyToolsuite
The most advanced modding platform for games running on DICE's Frostbite game engine.

## Setup

1. Download the source code.
2. Open the solution (found under FrostyEditor) with Visual Studio 2022, and make sure the project is set to ``Release - Final`` and ``x64``. Close out of retarget window if prompted.
3. Only build the projects themselves, never the solution.
